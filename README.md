# slide.ng for VS Code

Editor support for [slide.ng](https://github.com/slide-ng/slide.ng) decks: slides written in `slides.md` with Angular template syntax.

**Status: first version, not released.** The parts that do not need an editor are tested by `npm test`. Running inside a real VS Code was not checked (the `@vscode/test-electron` download is blocked in the build environment), so activation, the views, the preview webview and terminal behaviour on Windows and macOS are unverified.

## Features

- **Syntax highlighting** for `slides.md` (language `slide-ng`): slide separators, per-slide frontmatter, code fence options, Angular control flow and bindings, `::slot::` lines and `[click]` markers in notes.
- **Slides outline** in the side bar: number, title, layout and estimated click count per slide. Click a slide to jump to it.
- **Dev server** and **preview**: start and stop `slide-ng dev` in a terminal, and preview in a side panel that follows the cursor, or in your browser. The preview follows the deck's `routerMode` (`history`, `hash` or `memory`).
- **Edit slides**: move up or down, new slide below, duplicate.
- **Export** through `slide-ng export`, and a **status bar** item showing the current slide and server state.
- **Language**: the `slide-ng.lang` setting runs the dev server and the export in another language (`--lang`, slide.ng 2.0), for one deck in several languages.

The extension activates when the workspace has a `slides.md`, or when `slide-ng.entry` points to a deck file. It has no copy of the CLI: it runs your project's own `slide-ng` (by default `npx --no-install slide-ng`), so install slide.ng in your project first.

## Install and develop

There is no marketplace release yet. Build a `.vsix` and install it:

```sh
npm ci
npm run package
code --install-extension vscode-extension.vsix
```

Other scripts: `npm run build`, `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run format:check`. All commands are in the command palette under `Slide:`; settings are under `slide-ng.*` (entry file, CLI command, dev port, language, preview, outline, export). Both are listed in `package.json`.

## Known limits

- The `slide-ng` language mode replaces Markdown for the deck file, so Markdown-only features (such as the built-in Markdown preview) are not active in it.
- The click count is an estimate from the slide text, and `src:` imports are not followed.
- The preview reads `routerMode` from the deck's headmatter only; a theme or addon that sets it is not seen.
- Preview in remote windows (SSH, containers, Codespaces) is not checked.

For the full syntax and the CLI, see the documentation at [slide-ng.dev](https://slide-ng.dev).
